/**
 * Stage funnel analysis for India Staffing.
 *
 * For each pipeline stage, we compute:
 *   - `everReached`: how many reqs ever made it to this stage (current state
 *     at or past this stage, OR the audit log shows a transition into it)
 *   - `currentlyHere`: active reqs (non-archived) whose current stage === this
 *   - `stalledLost`:  reqs that reached this stage and ended up
 *     Closed-without-progress / Lost / Cancelled before moving forward
 *   - `dropOffFromPrev`: % drop from the previous stage's `everReached`
 *
 * We deliberately use the audit log as a source of truth for "ever reached" —
 * if a req is currently in "Client Round", we know it passed through
 * Sourcing → Profiles Shared → Interview → Shortlisted implicitly, even if
 * every stage change wasn't explicitly audit-logged.
